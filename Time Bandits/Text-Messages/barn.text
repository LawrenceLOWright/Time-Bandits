As you walk into Grampa’s Mystery Barn, the overpowering scent of old wood and dusty taxidermy fills your nose, while flickering lights highlight worn-out pinball machines. T-shirt racks and various tchotchkes line the walls. The highlight of the room is a full-sized Mothman fursuit, spotlighted tastefully by a flickering incandescent bulb. The teenage girl at the front desk, too engrossed in her social media feed, barely notices your arrival. She has a "My Friendly Equine: Caring is Sorcery" T-shirt on. 
You slot a quarter into the pinball machine. The machine lights up, sending a rush of excitement through you as the ball dances across the playfield. The satisfying clack of each target struck is like music, pulling you deeper into the game’s hypnotic rhythm. Of course, the ball eventually falls into a scummily placed hole, but a small slip of paper slides out of the coin slot.
The paper reads "In the drive-thru, late at night, I'm hoping for something in my sight. Not a break, but something sweet, what am I, to make ends meet?"
A stuffed fox sits unnaturally still, its mouth twisted into a permanent snarl, as though it’s waiting for the right moment to spring back to life. On the other side of the room, the glass eyes of a taxidermy deer seem to follow you. 
You pull out a t-shirt from the rack. "It says I Survived Grampa's Mystery Barn... Barely! with a picture of the barn with a shifty pair of eyes peering out. You check the price tag. It costs 45 dollars. You put the t-shirt back.
Slipping into the Mothman suit, the fabric clings uncomfortably tight, as if alive, and the eyeholes distort your vision into a shadowy twilight where the air shimmers with movement. As your eyes adjust, ghostly figures flicker into view, their hollow eyes locking onto yours, following your every movement. The Mothman suit vibrates with a low, eerie hum, like the wings of a moth beating against your skin, growing louder as more spirits gather around you. ??Your hands tremble as you fumble for the zipper, but the soft, plush fabric clings tighter with each tug, almost as if it’s resisting. The hum from the suit grows deafening, drowning out your panicked breaths as you claw desperately at the seams. Finally, with a fierce yank, the zipper tears open, and you stumble out, gasping for air as the suit crumples lifelessly to the floor. But even free from its grasp, you can still feel the phantom wings fluttering against your skin. "Are you okay?" The tour guide asks. "You seem really freaked out. Can I get you some water or anything?"
