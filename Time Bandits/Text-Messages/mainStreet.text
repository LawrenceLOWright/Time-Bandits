Many shops sit vacant, their windows grimy and covered with "For Sale" signs. A few old-fashioned lamp posts cast a dim glow on the cracked pavement. You see a few stores open - a library, a cafè named “The Kalfè,” and a MockDonald’s. 
You peer through the grimy, cracked windows of an abandoned storefront, catching a glimpse of dust-covered shelves and forgotten relics shrouded in darkness.
A dirt-cracked lamp post. A few flyers hang off of it - one says “WE NEED CHANGE NOW.” It’s clearly been on the lamppost for quite awhile. 
You don’t have a writing implement. How would you even do that?
