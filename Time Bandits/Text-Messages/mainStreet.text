Many shops sit vacant, their windows grimy and covered with "For Sale" signs. A few old-fashioned lamp posts cast a dim glow on the cracked pavement. You see a few stores open - a library, a cafe named "The Kalfe," and a MockDonald's.

A dirt-cracked lamp post. A few flyers hang off of it - one says "WE NEED CHANGE NOW." It’s clearly been on the lamp post for quite awhile. 
You don't have a writing implement. How would you even do that?
