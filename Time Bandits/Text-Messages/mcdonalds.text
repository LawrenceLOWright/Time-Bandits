The air inside MockDonald’s is thick with the smell of old fries and grease, with the once-bright red and yellow decor now faded and peeling. Behind the counter, an employee with drooping eyes and a hunched back stares at you, drumming his fingers on the counter. Behind him, some sort of dark liquid leaks out from under the door of a freezer. 
“That’ll be 6.89,” the tired employee says. You fork over the money and after some preparation, he hands over a red cardboard box filled with childhood dreams. Or MockNuggets. Same thing.
A toddler runs laps around the MockDonald’s, screaming at the top of her lungs. Her mom, a table over, scrolls on her phone. The employee stares blankly off into space.
You go over to the drinks machine and lock eyes with the tired employee. He looks a bit confused - you don’t have a cup. Then, you press down on the boca-cola button and soda streams down the counter. “I hate you,” the employee mouths as he goes to fetch a mop.
The MockDonald’s freezer stretches into an endless, frigid void, its walls lined with rows of frost-covered boxes that have no end in sight. The deeper you go, the air grows thick with the scent of old, frozen meat, and the faint hum of the refrigeration units turns into a low, haunting drone. You pass countless identical shelves, each packed with items that seem slightly older and more decayed than the last, until you realize you’ve been walking for hours. When you finally try to turn back, the door is gone, replaced by more cold, unyielding darkness.     Desperation fuels your sprint through the icy, endless aisles, each step echoing louder in the freezing abyss. Just as panic threatens to consume you, a faint glimmer of light appears ahead, growing brighter with every frantic stride. You burst through the door into the warmth of the kitchen, but when you glance back, the freezer door is gone, replaced by a smooth, unbroken wall.     “Told you,” the tired employee says. He pulls a vape from behind the counter, takes a long drag, and exhales the smoke into the grease laden air.
