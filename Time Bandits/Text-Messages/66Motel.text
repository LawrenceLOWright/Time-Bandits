Entering the shabby motel, you notice the dimly lit lobby and the strong odor of mildew that lingers in the air. At the front desk, an elderly woman with a shawl draped over her shoulders (Betsy) offers a weary glance, her fingers slowly sorting through a collection of outdated registration forms. An open cash box rests beside her. 
You check your wallet. A crumpled 20 stares out at you. Definitely not enough for a room. Also definitely not enough to cover the lice shampoo you'd probably need after staying here.
"I need a new towel. Could you get me one, please?" You ask the old lady. She looks at you spitefully, but trundles away dutifully. You take advantage of her absence to plunge your hand into the cash box and grab a handful of bills. By the time she returns, you're 50 dollars richer. You monster.
The mold blooms like a galaxy of decay, its blackened tendrils stretching across the ceiling like forgotten constellations in a dying night sky.
