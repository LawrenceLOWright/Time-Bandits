A long, dusty dirt road leads away from Hourglass, lined with dilapidated billboards bearing long-forgotten messages. Cornfields stretch endlessly into the distance, tall stalks swaying rhythmically in the breeze. You can see signs pointing to Legion Farms, Grampa’s Mystery Barn, and Motel 66. 
You spend a delightful few seconds rolling in the dirt before you start to feel stones digging into your skin. Ouch! Maybe you should pick some less rocky dust next time. 
You close your eyes and feel the - wait, there’s no breeze. Not even a wisp of wind. Huh. That’s weird. 
You clamber up the rusted iron rungs. One snaps off under your foot, and you spend a terrifying three seconds dangling by one hand. After that you decide maybe climbing isn’t worth it, but you notice a small slip of paper jammed in the broken rung. You grab it and put it in your pocket to look at once you’re on the ground.
You climb down and read the slip of paper, "In a room where travelers rest, I’m hidden where you’d probably guess. Crisp and folded, I’m out of sight, what am I, that brings delight?"
