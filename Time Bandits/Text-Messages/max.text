The exhausted worker slumps behind the counter, their eyes glazed over, a “I’ve seen the void” Reddit badge peeking out from under their uniform.
The employee looks at you with a flat stare.     “Can I take your order?” He asks pointedly. Seems like he isn’t paid to put up with small talk.     You see a name tag pinned to his red and yellow polo shirt. It reads, “MAX.”
Max looks over at the freezer. The dark liquid continues to ooze out of it.     “That place is nightmare fuel. I wouldn’t let you in if you paid me,” he says. He emphasizes “paid me” a little too hard, though. You suspect he would be amenable to bribery.
You slap 50 bucks on the counter. Max looks at and looks back at you. “Huh. You really paid me,” he says, stuffing the 50 bucks into his pocket. “Alright, one freezer trip, coming right up. Don’t say I didn’t warn you, though.”
