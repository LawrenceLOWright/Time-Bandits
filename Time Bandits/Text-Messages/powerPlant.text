A power plant, with its stark gray metal towers and jagged structures draped in tangled wires, rises abruptly from the middle of the cow field. A rusting chain link fence encircles the facility.
You lap the perimeter of the building. The fence goes all the way around, and there’s a gnarly looking padlock on the gate. However, tied to the padlock with a red ribbon, you notice a slip of paper.
it reads "When the mysteries unfold and the truth is clear, I’m the place that calls you near. Not a room, but under the sky, where must you go, and why?"
There’s barbed wire ringing the top of the fence. You’d probably die if you tried that.
You use the wire cutters to snip away the fence. The power plant lies before you. There’s a sign pointing to a control room - you decide to head there.
You enter the control room. It’s dimly lit, with flickering fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows over old, rust-streaked metal consoles. Worn-out switches and dials clutter the room, many of them labeled with peeling tape and barely legible, as a low hum of machinery vibrates through the grimy floor. Thick, grimy glass windows overlook a labyrinth of pipes and generators, while a faint smell of oil and burnt circuits lingers in the air. The air feels heavy, almost oppressive. As you  stare at the flickering control panels, a sudden realization dawns on you - the switches and dials aren’t just managing the city’s power grid, they’re controlling the eerie glow of the lights in the sky. You fiddle with a few controls. Your breath catches as you glance out the grimy window, watching in awe as the shifting beams of light respond to every subtle adjustment you make. You hear footsteps approaching. It’s time to go.
