The dirt path you walk along meanders through expansive pastures, where the occasional moo of cows punctuates the air thick with the scent of manure. Off in the distance, something electrical hums.
There’s a nice, chunky pile of cow manure a few paces from you. You get to digging. Underneath, you find a slip of paper, inexplicably clean.
the slip of paper reads "Where knowledge grows and minds ignite, I linger hidden, out of sight. Not for stories, but for snipping through, what am I, that cuts true?"
You decide to take a nice meander through the fields. It takes a bit of mental energy to avoid the plentiful cow dung, but once you get the hang of that, it’s quite pleasant. As you’re heading back to the path, your foot hits something cylindrical. You pick it up to reveal a signed My Friendly Equine: Caring is Sorcery poster. Huh. Wonder who threw it out here. You take it with you for safekeeping. 
You go up to one of the cows. It stares placidly up at you with wet eyes. You stroke a hand across its soft, silky fur. The cow leans into your hand.
