You realise that you are currently in Shady Pines Park. 
You see a neglected playground, covered in graffiti and grime, standing starkly against the cloudy sky. A sea of dandelions have overrun the grassy field around it,  their bright yellow heads a stark contrast to the park's otherwise desolate state.
You pick a bouquet of dandelions. In a flight of fancy, you consider making them into a dandelion crown, but settle for leaving the bundle under a leafless oak.
The swings creak ominously under your weight. Given how rusty they are, maybe itâ€™s best not to stay for too long.
