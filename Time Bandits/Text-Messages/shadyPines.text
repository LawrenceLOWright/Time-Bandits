You realise that you are currently in Shady Pines Park. 
You see a neglected playground, covered in graffiti and grime, standing starkly against the cloudy sky. A sea of dandelions have overrun the grassy field around it,  their bright yellow heads a stark contrast to the park's otherwise desolate state.
You pick a bouquet of dandelions. In a flight of fancy, you consider making them into a dandelion crown, but settle for leaving the bundle under a leafless oak.
The swings creak ominously under your weight. Given how rusty they are, maybe it's best not to stay for too long.
Someone's chipped "M + L forever" into the dusty purple paint. Forever's an awfully long time - are they still together?
As you wander through the overgrown, crumbling paths of Shady Pines Park, your eyes catch an unfamiliar trail hidden beneath tangled vines and fallen leaves. Something about the shadowy path feels wrong, as if it has always been there, quietly waiting for you to notice it. As you follow the hidden path, the air grows colder, and ahead, a towering glass wall emerges from the dense foliage, stretching impossibly high into the sky. The surface is smooth and flawless, reflecting the decaying park behind you, yet revealing nothing of what lies beyond. You look up, seeing the glass taper inwards towards a ceiling. There’s a small hole in the center of the prism. And then it hits you - you’re in a giant hourglass. You step cautiously toward the edge of the towering hourglass, its glass surface fogged and cracked, casting distorted reflections of the overgrown park around you. Vines creep up the hourglass' base, wrapping around it like nature reclaiming the strange structure, while the air grows thick with the scent of damp earth and decay. As you approach the inner edge, a strange, oppressive stillness settles over the park, as if time itself is holding its breath. You swing the hammer with all your might, and the edge of the giant hourglass erupts in a shower of glass shards. Time seems to shatter with the glass, sending fragments of reality scattering in every direction.
You, and the people of Hourglass, are free.
