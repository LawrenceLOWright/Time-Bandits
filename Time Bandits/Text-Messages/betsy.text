The old motel clerk, grumbling under her breath, sits behind the desk with a weathered face that seems permanently set in a scowl, her eyes darting warily toward the shotgun discreetly stashed beneath. 
The old clerk narrows her eyes and grunts, “Weird slips of paper? Like this?” She pulls out a small slip. “Some sort of prankster’s been leaving them around. You can have it - it means nothing to me.”
The slip of paper reads "In a barn where cows reside, I’m found where ponies don’t usually hide. Not flesh and bone, but paper thin, what am I, with a cartoon grin?"
“The name’s Nonya,” she says with a scowl. “Nonya business.”
She gives you a weary, almost dismissive glance, saying, “That old thing? It’s just a precaution. Around here, you never know when someone’s gonna get a wild idea, and it’s best to be prepared.”
