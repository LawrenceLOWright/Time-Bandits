# Hourglass
A text-based, time looping adventure built with C++. 

## Project Description
Hourglass is a text-based game set in the town of Hourglass, a small town under the effects of a mysterious time loop. The player has to use a series of riddles to uncover the mysteries of Hourglass and save it from it's grizzly fate. However, the loops get shorter and shorter and the game goes on, forcing the player to be strategic with their resources. 

Hourglass is coded entirely in C++ with no external libraries, save for basic libraries included in the Windows system.
